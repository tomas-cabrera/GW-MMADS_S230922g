  abstract = {On 2017 August 17, the gravitational-wave event GW170817 was observed by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, and the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 170817A was observed independently by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and the Anti-Coincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory. The probability of the near-simultaneous temporal and spatial observation of GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurring by chance is 5.0{\texttimes} \{10\}-8. We therefore confirm binary neutron star mergers as a progenitor of short GRBs. The association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A provides new insight into fundamental physics and the origin of short GRBs. We use the observed time delay of (+1.74+/- 0.05) \{\{s\}\} between GRB 170817A and GW170817 to: (I) constrain the difference between the speed of gravity and the speed of light to be between -3{\texttimes} \{10\}-15 and +7{\texttimes} \{10\}-16 times the speed of light, (II) place new bounds on the violation of Lorentz invariance, (III) present a new test of the equivalence principle by constraining the Shapiro delay between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. We also use the time delay to constrain the size and bulk Lorentz factor of the region emitting the gamma-rays. GRB 170817A is the closest short GRB with a known distance, but is between 2 and 6 orders of magnitude less energetic than other bursts with measured redshift. A new generation of gamma-ray detectors, and subthreshold searches in existing detectors, will be essential to detect similar short bursts at greater distances. Finally, we predict a joint detection rate for the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors of 0.1-1.4 per year during the 2018-2019 observing run and 0.3-1.7 per year at design sensitivity.},

  abstract = {On 17 August 2017, the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors observed the gravitational-wave event GW170817---a strong signal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system. Less than two seconds after the merger, a {$\gamma$}-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a region of the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of the gravitational-wave source. This sky region was subsequently observed by optical astronomy facilities, resulting in the identification of an optical transient signal within about ten arcseconds of the galaxy NGC 4993. This detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves represents the first `multi-messenger' astronomical observation. Such observations enable GW170817 to be used as a `standard siren' (meaning that the absolute distance to the source can be determined directly from the gravitational-wave measurements) to measure the Hubble constant. This quantity represents the local expansion rate of the Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamental importance to cosmology. Here we report a measurement of the Hubble constant that combines the distance to the source inferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocity inferred from measurements of the redshift using the electromagnetic data. In contrast to previous measurements, ours does not require the use of a cosmic `distance ladder': the gravitational-wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance out to cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomical distance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be about 70 kilometres per second per megaparsec. This value is consistent with existing measurements, while being completely independent of them. Additional standard siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources will enable the Hubble constant to be constrained to high precision.},

  abstract = {On 17 August 2017, the LIGO and Virgo observatories made the first direct detection of gravitational waves from the coalescence of a neutron star binary system. The detection of this gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, offers a novel opportunity to directly probe the properties of matter at the extreme conditions found in the interior of these stars. The initial, minimal-assumption analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data placed constraints on the tidal effects of the coalescing bodies, which were then translated to constraints on neutron star radii. Here, we expand upon previous analyses by working under the hypothesis that both bodies were neutron stars that are described by the same equation of state and have spins within the range observed in Galactic binary neutron stars. Our analysis employs two methods: the use of equation-of-state-insensitive relations between various macroscopic properties of the neutron stars and the use of an efficient parametrization of the defining function p ({$\rho$} ) of the equation of state itself. From the LIGO and Virgo data alone and the first method, we measure the two neutron star radii as R1=10.8-1.7+2.0 km for the heavier star and R2=10.7-1.5+2.1 km for the lighter star at the 90\% credible level. If we additionally require that the equation of state supports neutron stars with masses larger than 1.97 M{$\odot$} as required from electromagnetic observations and employ the equation-of-state parametrization, we further constrain R1=11.9-1.4+1.4 km and R2=11.9-1.4+1.4 km at the 90\% credible level. Finally, we obtain constraints on p ({$\rho$} ) at supranuclear densities, with pressure at twice nuclear saturation density measured at 3.5-1.7+2.7{\texttimes}1034 dyn cm-2 at the 90\% level.},

  abstract = {On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of {$\sim$} 1.7 \{\{s\}\} with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of \{40\}-8+8 Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 \{M\}{$\odot$} . An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at {$\sim$} 40 \{\{Mpc\}\}) less than 11 hours after the merger by the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope. The optical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour. Subsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours. Optical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over {$\sim$}10 days. Following early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered at the transient's position {$\sim$} 9 and {$\sim$} 16 days, respectively, after the merger. Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical process that is distinct from the one that generates the UV/optical/near-infrared emission. No ultra-high-energy gamma-rays and no neutrino candidates consistent with the source were found in follow-up searches. These observations support the hypothesis that GW170817 was produced by the merger of two neutron stars in NGC 4993 followed by a short gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) and a kilonova/macronova powered by the radioactive decay of r-process nuclei synthesized in the ejecta.

  abstract = {Synoptic searches for the optical counterpart to a binary neutron star (BNS) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger can pose significant challenges towards the discovery of kilonovae and performing multi-messenger science. In this work, we describe the advantage of a global multi-telescope network towards this end, with a particular focus on the key and complementary role the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) plays in multi-facility follow-up. We describe the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) Marshal, a common web application we built to ingest events, plan observations, search for transient candidates, and retrieve performance summary statistics for all of the telescopes in our network. Our infrastructure enabled us to conduct observations of two events during O3a, S190426c and S190510g. Furthermore, our analysis of deep DECam observations of S190814bv conducted by the DESGW team, and access to a variety of global follow-up facilities allowed us to place meaningful constraints on the parameters of the kilonova and the merging binary. We emphasize the importance of a global telescope network in conjunction with a power telescope like DECam in performing searches for the counterparts to gravitational-wave sources.},

  abstract = {The discovery of the first electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave signal has generated follow-up observations by over 50 facilities world-wide, ushering in the new era of multi-messenger astronomy. In this paper, we present follow-up observations of the gravitational wave event GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart SSS17a/DLT17ck (IAU label AT2017gfo) by 14 Australian telescopes and partner observatories as part of Australian-based and Australian-led research programs. We report early- to late-time multi-wavelength observations, including optical imaging and spectroscopy, mid-infrared imaging, radio imaging, and searches for fast radio bursts. Our optical spectra reveal that the transient source emission cooled from approximately 6 400 K to 2 100 K over a 7-d period and produced no significant optical emission lines. The spectral profiles, cooling rate, and photometric light curves are consistent with the expected outburst and subsequent processes of a binary neutron star merger. Star formation in the host galaxy probably ceased at least a Gyr ago, although there is evidence for a galaxy merger. Binary pulsars with short (100 Myr) decay times are therefore unlikely progenitors, but pulsars like PSR B1534+12 with its 2.7 Gyr coalescence time could produce such a merger. The displacement ( 2.2 kpc) of the binary star system from the centre of the main galaxy is not unusual for stars in the host galaxy or stars originating in the merging galaxy, and therefore any constraints on the kick velocity imparted to the progenitor are poor.},

  abstract = {The first two months of the third Advanced LIGO and Virgo observing run (2019 April-May) showed that distant gravitational-wave (GW) events can now be readily detected. Three candidate mergers containing neutron stars (NS) were reported in a span of 15 days, all likely located more than 100 Mpc away. However, distant events such as the three new NS mergers are likely to be coarsely localized, which highlights the importance of facilities and scheduling systems that enable deep observations over hundreds to thousands of square degrees to detect the electromagnetic counterparts. On 2019 May 10 02:59:39.292 UT the GW candidate S190510g was discovered and initially classified as a binary neutron star (BNS) merger with 98\% probability. The GW event was localized within an area of 3462 deg2, later refined to 1166 deg2 (90\%) at a distance of 227 {\textpm} 92 Mpc. We triggered Target-of-Opportunity observations with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a wide-field optical imager mounted at the prime focus of the 4 m Blanco Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. This Letter describes our DECam observations and our real-time analysis results, focusing in particular on the design and implementation of the observing strategy. Within 24 hr of the merger time, we observed 65\% of the total enclosed probability of the final skymap with an observing efficiency of 94\%. We identified and publicly announced 13 candidate counterparts. S190510g was reclassified 1.7 days after the merger, after our observations were completed, with a ``BNS merger'' probability reduced from 98\% to 42\% in favor of a ``terrestrial classification.},

  abstract = {On 2019 August 14, the Advanced LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected the high-significance gravitational wave (GW) signal S190814bv. The GW data indicated that the event resulted from a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger, or potentially a low-mass binary BH merger. Due to the low false-alarm rate and the precise localization (23 deg2 at 90\%), S190814bv presented the community with the best opportunity yet to directly observe an optical/near-infrared counterpart to an NSBH merger. To search for potential counterparts, the GROWTH Collaboration performed real-time image subtraction on six nights of public Dark Energy Camera images acquired in the 3 weeks following the merger, covering {$>$}98\% of the localization probability. Using a worldwide network of follow-up facilities, we systematically undertook spectroscopy and imaging of optical counterpart candidates. Combining these data with a photometric redshift catalog, we ruled out each candidate as the counterpart to S190814bv and placed deep, uniform limits on the optical emission associated with S190814bv. For the nearest consistent GW distance, radiative transfer simulations of NSBH mergers constrain the ejecta mass of S190814bv to be Mej {$<$} 0.04 M{$\odot$} at polar viewing angles, or Mej {$<$} 0.03 M{$\odot$} if the opacity is {$\kappa$} {$<$} 2 cm2g-1. Assuming a tidal deformability for the NS at the high end of the range compatible with GW170817 results, our limits would constrain the BH spin component aligned with the orbital momentum to be {$\chi$} {$<$} 0.7 for mass ratios Q {$<$} 6, with weaker constraints for more compact NSs.},

  abstract = {The collapse of a stellar core is expected to produce gravitational waves (GWs), neutrinos, and in most cases a luminous supernova. Sometimes, however, the optical event could be significantly less luminous than a supernova and a direct collapse to a black hole, where the star just disappears, is possible. The GW event GW150914 was detected by the LIGO Virgo Collaboration via a burst analysis that gave localization contours enclosing the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Shortly thereafter, we used DECam to observe 102 deg2 of the localization area, including 38 deg2 on the LMC for a missing supergiant search. We construct a complete catalog of LMC luminous red supergiants, the best candidates to undergo invisible core collapse, and collected catalogs of other candidates: less luminous red supergiants, yellow supergiants, blue supergiants, luminous blue variable stars, and Wolf--Rayet stars. Of the objects in the imaging region, all are recovered in the images. The timescale for stellar disappearance is set by the free-fall time, which is a function of the stellar radius. Our observations at 4 and 13 days after the event result in a search sensitive to objects of up to about 200 solar radii. We conclude that it is unlikely that GW150914 was caused by the core collapse of a relatively compact supergiant in the LMC, consistent with the LIGO Collaboration analyses of the gravitational waveform as best interpreted as a high mass binary black hole merger. We discuss how to generalize this search for future very nearby core-collapse candidates.},

  abstract = {The merger of two neutron stars has been predicted to produce an optical-infrared transient (lasting a few days) known as a `kilonova', powered by the radioactive decay of neutron-rich species synthesized in the merger. Evidence that short {$\gamma$}-ray bursts also arise from neutron-star mergers has been accumulating. In models of such mergers, a small amount of mass (10-4-10-2 solar masses) with a low electron fraction is ejected at high velocities (0.1-0.3 times light speed) or carried out by winds from an accretion disk formed around the newly merged object. This mass is expected to undergo rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, leading to the formation of radioactive elements that release energy as they decay, powering an electromagnetic transient. A large uncertainty in the composition of the newly synthesized material leads to various expected colours, durations and luminosities for such transients. Observational evidence for kilonovae has so far been inconclusive because it was based on cases of moderate excess emission detected in the afterglows of {$\gamma$}-ray bursts. Here we report optical to near-infrared observations of a transient coincident with the detection of the gravitational-wave signature of a binary neutron-star merger and with a low-luminosity short-duration {$\gamma$}-ray burst. Our observations, taken roughly every eight hours over a few days following the gravitational-wave trigger, reveal an initial blue excess, with fast optical fading and reddening. Using numerical models, we conclude that our data are broadly consistent with a light curve powered by a few hundredths of a solar mass of low-opacity material corresponding to lanthanide-poor (a fraction of 10-4.5 by mass) ejecta.},

Probing the origin of binary black hole mergers will be difficult due to the expected lack of electromagnetic emission and limited localization accuracy. Associations with rare host galaxy types---such as active galactic nuclei---can nevertheless be identified statistically through spatial correlation. Here we establish the feasibility of statistically proving the connection between binary black hole mergers and active galactic nuclei as hosts, even if only a sub-population of mergers originate from active galactic nuclei. Our results are the demonstration that the limited localization of gravitational waves, previously written off as not useful to distinguish progenitor channels, can in fact contribute key information, broadening the range of astrophysical questions probed by binary black hole observations.},

Galactic nuclei are expected to harbor the densest population of stellar-mass black holes. A significant fraction ({$\sim$} 30 \% ) of these black holes can reside in binaries. We examine the fate of the black hole binaries in active galactic nuclei, which get trapped in the inner region of the accretion disk around the central supermassive black hole. We show that binary black holes can migrate into and then rapidly merge within the disk well within a Salpeter time. The binaries may also accrete a significant amount of gas from the disk, well above the Eddington rate. This could lead to detectable X-ray or gamma-ray emission, but would require hyper-Eddington accretion with a few percent radiative efficiency, comparable to thin disks. We discuss implications for gravitational-wave observations and black hole population studies. We estimate that Advanced LIGO may detect {$\sim$}20 such gas-induced binary mergers per year.},

Current constraints suggest that \${\textbackslash}sim 20-80{\textbackslash}\%\$ of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) Binary Black Hole (BBH) mergers occur in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks. The claim for a possible association of several BBH mergers with flaring AGNs suggests that cosmological analyses using BBH and AGNs might be promising. We explore standard siren analyses through a method that takes into account the presence of background flaring AGNs, without requiring a unique host galaxy identification, and apply it to realistic GW simulations. Depending on the fraction of LVK BBHs that induce flares, we expect to constrain \$H\_0\$ at the \${\textbackslash}sim 3.5-7{\textbackslash}\%\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim 2.5-5{\textbackslash}\%\$) precision with \${\textbackslash}sim 2\$ years or \${\textbackslash}sim 160\$ events (\${\textbackslash}sim 1\$ year or \$500\$ events) of LVK at design (A+) sensitivity, assuming that systematic BBH follow-up searches are performed.

  abstract = {We present a novel method to produce empirical generative models of all kinds of astronomical transients from data sets of unlabeled light curves. Our hybrid model, which we call ParSNIP, uses a neural network to model the unknown intrinsic diversity of different transients and an explicit physics-based model of how light from the transient propagates through the universe and is observed. The ParSNIP model predicts the time-varying spectra of transients despite only being trained on photometric observations. With a three-dimensional intrinsic model, we are able to fit out-of-sample multiband light curves of many different kinds of transients with model uncertainties of 0.04-0.06 mag. The representation learned by the ParSNIP model is invariant to redshift, so it can be used to perform photometric classification of transients even with heavily biased training sets. Our classification techniques significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on both simulated (PLAsTiCC) and real (PS1) data sets with 2.3{\texttimes} and 2{\texttimes} less contamination, respectively, for classification of Type Ia supernovae. We demonstrate how our model can identify previously unobserved kinds of transients and produce a sample that is 90\% pure. The ParSNIP model can also estimate distances to Type Ia supernovae in the PS1 data set with an rms of 0.150 {\textpm} 0.007 mag compared to 0.155 {\textpm} 0.008 mag for the SALT2 model on the same sample. We discuss how our model could be used to produce distance estimates for supernova cosmology without the need for explicit classification.},

  abstract = {The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) was completed in 2005 and began initial scientific operations in August of that year. Built in just under 6 years and on budget, SALT has been a good example of a successfully managed telescope project where systems engineering disciplines have been applied to good effect. This paper discusses the experiences of completing and commissioning SALT and its first-light instruments and the early scientific operations. Lessons learned in integrating the various telescope subsystems and implementation of the telescope control system are presented. First Light was announced on 1 September 2005 following the installation of the last of the 91 mirror segments and the commissioning of the UV-visible imager, SALTICAM. This was soon followed by the first scientific observations and the beginning of the commissioning phase for the active optics system.},

  abstract = {The University of Wisconsin - Madison, together with Rutgers University and the South African Astronomical Observatory, is designing and building an imaging spectrograph for the Prime Focus Instrument Package of the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). The Prime Focus Imaging Spectrograph (PFIS) will be a versatile instrument specializing in very high throughput, low and medium resolution (R=500-12,500) imaging spectroscopy, using volume phase holographic (VPH) gratings and a double etalon Fabry-Perot interferometer, and spectropolarimetry from 320 to 900 nm. The optical design includes all transmissive optics for high efficiency and compactness. To maintain throughput in the ultraviolet, only fused silica, CaF2 and NaCl are used. As NaCl is very hygroscopic, the design uses NaCl as the inner element in sealed triplets only. For the highest possible first-order spectral resolution, the collimated beam size is 150 mm - the maximum for practical Fabry-Perot etalons. The F/2.2 camera can be articulated to tune the efficiency of the VPH gratings; a complement of six gratings (5 VPH and 1 standard transmission grating) has been designed to fill the resolution-wavelength space available to the instrument. Linear, circular, and all-stokes spectropolarimetry will be performed through the use of Pancharatnam superachromatic waveplates and a Wollaston beamsplitter.},

While binary black hole (BBH) events are not expected to produce an electromagnetic (EM) signature, emission is certainly not impossible. The DESGW program has performed follow-up observations of four BBH events detected by LIGO in order to search for any possible EM counterpart. Failure to find such counterparts is still relevant in that it produces limits on optical emission from such events. This is a review of follow-up results from O1 BBH events and a discussion of the status of ongoing uniform re-analysis of all BBH events that DESGW has followed up to date.},

  abstract = {Gravitational-wave detections provide a novel way to determine the Hubble constant1-3, which is the current rate of expansion of the Universe. This `standard siren' method, with the absolute distance calibration provided by the general theory of relativity, was used to measure the Hubble constant using the gravitational-wave detection of the binary neutron-star merger, GW170817, by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo4, combined with optical identification of the host galaxy5,6 NGC 4993. This independent measurement is of particular interest given the discrepancy between the value of the Hubble constant determined using type Ia supernovae via the local distance ladder (73.24 {\textpm} 1.74 kilometres per second per megaparsec) and the value determined from cosmic microwave background observations (67.4 {\textpm} 0.5 kilometres per second per megaparsec): these values differ7,8 by about 3{$\sigma$}. Local distance ladder observations may achieve a precision of one per cent within five years, but at present there are no indications that further observations will substantially reduce the existing discrepancies9. Here we show that additional gravitational-wave detections by LIGO and Virgo can be expected to constrain the Hubble constant to a precision of approximately two per cent within five years and approximately one per cent within a decade. This is because observing gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron stars, together with the identification of a host galaxy, enables a direct measurement of the Hubble constant independent of the systematics associated with other available methods. In addition to clarifying the discrepancy between existing low-redshift (local ladder) and high-redshift (cosmic microwave background) measurements, a precision measurement of the Hubble constant is of crucial value in elucidating the nature of dark energy10,11.},

  abstract = {Due to their short timescale, stellar flares are a challenging target for the most modern synoptic sky surveys. The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), a project designed to collect more data than any precursor survey, is unlikely to detect flares with more than one data point in its main survey. We developed a methodology to enable LSST studies of stellar flares, with a focus on flare temperature and temperature evolution, which remain poorly constrained compared to flare morphology. By leveraging the sensitivity expected from the Rubin system, Differential Chromatic Refraction can be used to constrain flare temperature from a single-epoch detection, which will enable statistical studies of flare temperatures and constrain models of the physical processes behind flare emission using the unprecedentedly high volume of data produced by Rubin over the 10-year LSST. We model the refraction effect as a function of the atmospheric column density, photometric filter, and temperature of the flare, and show that flare temperatures at or above {\textasciitilde}4,000K can be constrained by a single g-band observation at airmass X {$>$} 1.2, given the minimum specified requirement on single-visit relative astrometric accuracy of LSST, and that a surprisingly large number of LSST observations is in fact likely be conducted at X {$>$} 1.2, in spite of image quality requirements pushing the survey to preferentially low X. Having failed to measure flare DCR in LSST precursor surveys, we make recommendations on survey design and data products that enable these studies in LSST and other future surveys.},

  abstract = {SkyPortal is an open-source software package designed to discover interesting transients efficiently, manage follow-up, perform characterization, and visualize the results. By enabling fast access to archival and catalog data, crossmatching heterogeneous data streams, and the triggering and monitoring of on-demand observations for further characterization, a SkyPortal-based platform has been operating at scale for {$>$}2 yr for the Zwicky Transient Facility Phase II community, with hundreds of users, containing tens of millions of time-domain sources, interacting with dozens of telescopes, and enabling community reporting. While SkyPortal emphasizes rich user experiences across common front-end workflows, recognizing that scientific inquiry is increasingly performed programmatically, SkyPortal also surfaces an extensive and well-documented application programming interface system. From back-end and front-end software to data science analysis tools and visualization frameworks, the SkyPortal design emphasizes the reuse and leveraging of best-in-class approaches, with a strong extensibility ethos. For instance, SkyPortal now leverages ChatGPT large language models to generate and surface source-level human-readable summaries automatically. With the imminent restart of the next generation of gravitational-wave detectors, SkyPortal now also includes dedicated multimessenger features addressing the requirements of rapid multimessenger follow-up: multitelescope management, team/group organizing interfaces, and crossmatching of multimessenger data streams with time-domain optical surveys, with interfaces sufficiently intuitive for newcomers to the field. This paper focuses on the detailed implementations, capabilities, and early science results that establish SkyPortal as a community software package ready to take on the data science challenges and opportunities presented by this next chapter in the multimessenger era.},

Due to the size of the error regions, which can span hundreds to thousands of square degrees, there are significant benefits to optimizing tilings for these large sky areas. The rich science promised by gravitational-wave astronomy has led to the proposal for a variety of tiling and time allocation schemes, and for the first time, we make a systematic comparison of some of these methods. We find that differences of a factor of 2 or more in efficiency are possible, depending on the algorithm employed. For this reason, for future surveys searching for electromagnetic counterparts, care should be taken when selecting tiling, time allocation, and scheduling algorithms to maximize the probability of counterpart detection.},

  abstract = {We report the results of a Dark Energy Camera optical follow-up of the gravitational-wave (GW) event GW151226, discovered by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory detectors. Our observations cover 28.8 deg2 of the localization region in the I and z bands (containing 3\% of the BAYESTAR localization probability), starting 10 hr after the event was announced and spanning four epochs at 2-24 days after the GW detection. We achieve 5{$\sigma$} point-source limiting magnitudes of I{$\approx$} 21.7 and z{$\approx$} 21.5, with a scatter of 0.4 mag, in our difference images. Given the two-day delay, we search this area for a rapidly declining optical counterpart with {$\greaterequivlnt$} 3{$\sigma$} significance steady decline between the first and final observations. We recover four sources that pass our selection criteria, of which three are cataloged active galactic nuclei. The fourth source is offset by 5.8 arcsec from the center of a galaxy at a distance of 187 Mpc, exhibits a rapid decline by 0.5 mag over 4 days, and has a red color of I-z{$\approx$} 0.3 mag. These properties could satisfy a set of cuts designed to identify kilonovae. However, this source was detected several times, starting 94 days prior to GW151226, in the Pan-STARRS Survey for Transients (dubbed as PS15cdi) and is therefore unrelated to the GW event. Given its long-term behavior, PS15cdi is likely a Type IIP supernova that transitioned out of its plateau phase during our observations, mimicking a kilonova-like behavior. We comment on the implications of this detection for contamination in future optical follow-up observations.},

Our data set extends from the discovery of the optical counterpart at 0.47--18.5 days post-merger, and includes observations with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), Gemini-South/FLAMINGOS-2 (GS/F2), and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The spectral energy distribution (SED) inferred from this photometry at 0.6 days is well described by a blackbody model with K, a radius of cm (corresponding to an expansion velocity of ), and a bolometric luminosity of erg s-1. At 1.5 days we find a multi-component SED across the optical and NIR, and subsequently we observe rapid fading in the UV and blue optical bands and significant reddening of the optical/NIR colors. Modeling the entire data set, we find that models with heating from radioactive decay of 56Ni, or those with only a single component of opacity from r-process elements, fail to capture the rapid optical decline and red optical/NIR colors. Instead, models with two components consistent with lanthanide-poor and lanthanide-rich ejecta provide a good fit to the data; the resulting ``blue'' component has and , and the ``red'' component has and . These ejecta masses are broadly consistent with the estimated r-process production rate required to explain the Milky Way r-process abundances, providing the first evidence that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can be a dominant site of r-process enrichment.},

  abstract = {We present the final catalogue of the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ), based on Anglo-Australian Telescope 2dF spectroscopic observations of 44 576 colour-selected (ubJr) objects with 18.25 {$<$} bJ {$<$} 20.85 selected from automated plate measurement scans of UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) photographic plates. The 2QZ comprises 23 338 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), 12 292 galactic stars (including 2071 white dwarfs) and 4558 compact narrow emission-line galaxies. We obtained a reliable spectroscopic identification for 86 per cent of objects observed with 2dF. We also report on the 6dF QSO Redshift Survey (6QZ), based on UKST 6dF observations of 1564 brighter(16 {$<$} bJ {$<$} 18.25) sources selected from the same photographic input catalogue. In total, we identified 322 QSOs spectroscopically in the 6QZ. The completed 2QZ is, by more than a factor of 50, the largest homogeneous QSO catalogue ever constructed at these faint limits (bJ {$<$} 20.85) and high QSO surface densities (35 QSOs deg-2). As such, it represents an important resource in the study of the Universe at moderate-to-high redshifts. As an example of the results possible with the 2QZ, we also present our most recent analysis of the optical QSO luminosity function and its cosmological evolution with redshift. For a flat, {\textohm}m= 0.3 and {\textohm}{$\Lambda$}= 0.7, universe, we find that a double power law with luminosity evolution that is exponential in look-back time, {$\tau$}, of the form LbJ*(z){\textasciitilde} e6.15{$\tau$}, equivalent to an e-folding time of 2 Gyr, provides an acceptable fit to the redshift dependence of the QSO LF over the range 0.4 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.1 and MbJ {$<$} -22.5. Evolution described by a quadratic in redshift is also an acceptable fit, with LbJ*(z){\textasciitilde} 101.39z-0.29z2.},

  abstract = {On 17 August 2017, gravitational waves (GWs) were detected from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the ejection of neutron-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least {\textasciitilde}0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that neutron star mergers play a role in rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.},

  abstract = {Context. The AGN bolometric correction is a key element for understanding black hole (BH) demographics and computing accurate BH accretion histories from AGN luminosities. However, current estimates still differ from each other by up to a factor of two to three, and rely on extrapolations at the lowest and highest luminosities. Aims: Here we revisit this fundamental question by presenting general hard X-ray (KX) and optical (KO) bolometric corrections, computed by combining several AGN samples spanning the widest (about 7 dex) luminosity range ever used for this type of studies. Methods: We analysed a total of {$\sim$}1000 type 1 and type 2 AGN for which we performed a dedicated SED-fitting. Results: We provide a bolometric correction separately for type 1 and type 2 AGN; the two bolometric corrections agree in the overlapping luminosity range. Based on this we computed for the first time a universal bolometric correction for the whole AGN sample (both type 1 and type 2). We found that KX is fairly constant at log(LBOL/L{$\odot$}) {$<$} 11, while it increases up to about one order of magnitude at log(LBOL/L{$\odot$}) {$\sim$} 14.5. A similar increasing trend has been observed when its dependence on either the Eddington ratio or the BH mass is considered, while no dependence on redshift up to z {$\sim$} 3.5 has been found. In contrast, the optical bolometric correction appears to be fairly constant (i.e. KO {$\sim$} 5) regardless of the independent variable. We also verified that our bolometric corrections correctly predict the AGN bolometric luminosity functions. According to this analysis, our bolometric corrections can be applied to the whole AGN population in a wide range of luminosity and redshift.},

The 570 megapixel focal plane comprises 62 2k {\texttimes} 4k CCDs for imaging and 12 2k {\texttimes} 2k CCDs for guiding and focus. The CCDs have 15 {$\mu$}m {\texttimes} 15 {$\mu$}m pixels with a plate scale of 0.{${''}$}263 pixel-1. A hexapod system provides state-of-the-art focus and alignment capability. The camera is read out in 20 s with 6-9 electron readout noise. This paper provides a technical description of the camera's engineering, construction, installation, and current status.},

  abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia},

  abstract = {We present the results from a search for the electromagnetic counterpart of the LIGO/Virgo event S190510g using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). S190510g is a binary neutron star (BNS) merger candidate of moderate significance detected at a distance of 227 {\textpm} 92 Mpc and localized within an area of 31 (1166) square degrees at 50\% (90\%) confidence. While this event was later classified as likely nonastrophysical in nature within 30 hours of the event, our short latency search and discovery pipeline identified 11 counterpart candidates, all of which appear consistent with supernovae following offline analysis and spectroscopy by other instruments. Later reprocessing of the images enabled the recovery of six more candidates. Additionally, we implement our candidate selection procedure on simulated kilonovae and supernovae under DECam observing conditions (e.g., seeing and exposure time) with the intent of quantifying our search efficiency and making informed decisions on observing strategy for future similar events. This is the first BNS counterpart search to employ a comprehensive simulation-based efficiency study. We find that using the current follow-up strategy, there would need to be 19 events similar to S190510g for us to have a 99\% chance of detecting an optical counterpart, assuming a GW170817-like kilonova. We further conclude that optimization of observing plans, which should include preference for deeper images over multiple color information, could result in up to a factor of 1.5 reduction in the total number of follow-ups needed for discovery.},

  abstract = {The Swift mission, scheduled for launch in 2004, is a multiwavelength observatory for gamma-ray burst (GRB) astronomy. It is a first-of-its-kind autonomous rapid-slewing satellite for transient astronomy and pioneers the way for future rapid-reaction and multiwavelength missions. It will be far more powerful than any previous GRB mission, observing more than 100 bursts yr-1 and performing detailed X-ray and UV/optical afterglow observations spanning timescales from 1 minute to several days after the burst. The objectives are to (1) determine the origin of GRBs, (2) classify GRBs and search for new types, (3) study the interaction of the ultrarelativistic outflows of GRBs with their surrounding medium, and (4) use GRBs to study the early universe out to z{$>$}10. The mission is being developed by a NASA-led international collaboration. It will carry three instruments: a new-generation wide-field gamma-ray (15-150 keV) detector that will detect bursts, calculate 1'-4' positions, and trigger autonomous spacecraft slews; a narrow-field X-ray telescope that will give 5" positions and perform spectroscopy in the 0.2-10 keV band; and a narrow-field UV/optical telescope that will operate in the 170-600 nm band and provide 0.3" positions and optical finding charts. Redshift determinations will be made for most bursts. In addition to the primary GRB science, the mission will perform a hard X-ray survey to a sensitivity of {\textasciitilde}1 mcrab ({\textasciitilde}2{\texttimes}10-11 ergs cm-2 s-1 in the 15-150 keV band), more than an order of magnitude better than HEAO 1 A-4. A flexible data and operations system will allow rapid follow-up observations of all types of high-energy transients, with rapid data downlink and uplink available through the NASA TDRSS system. Swift transient data will be rapidly distributed to the astronomical community, and all interested observers are encouraged to participate in follow-up measurements. A Guest Investigator program for the mission will provide funding for community involvement. Innovations from the Swift program applicable to the future include (1) a large-area gamma-ray detector using the new CdZnTe detectors, (2) an autonomous rapid-slewing spacecraft, (3) a multiwavelength payload combining optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray instruments, (4) an observing program coordinated with other ground-based and space-based observatories, and (5) immediate multiwavelength data flow to the community. The mission is currently funded for 2 yr of operations, and the spacecraft will have a lifetime to orbital decay of {\textasciitilde}8 yr.},

Its afterglow emission may have been produced by either a narrow relativistic jet or an isotropic outflow. High-spatial-resolution measurements of the source size and displacement can discriminate between these scenarios. We present very-long-baseline interferometry observations, performed 207.4 days after the merger by using a global network of 32 radio telescopes. The apparent source size is constrained to be smaller than 2.5 milli-arc seconds at the 90\% confidence level. This excludes the isotropic outflow scenario, which would have produced a larger apparent size, indicating that GW170817 produced a structured relativistic jet. Our rate calculations show that at least 10\% of neutron star mergers produce such a jet.},

  abstract = {The discovery of a transient kilonova following the gravitational-wave (GW) event GW170817 highlighted the critical need for coordinated rapid and wide-field observations, inference, and follow-up across the electromagnetic spectrum. In the southern hemisphere, the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Blanco 4 m telescope is well suited to this task, as it is able to cover wide fields quickly while still achieving the depths required to find kilonovae like the one accompanying GW170817 to {$\sim$}500 Mpc, the binary neutron star (NS) horizon distance for current generation of LIGO/Virgo collaboration (LVC) interferometers. Here, as part of the multi-facility follow-up by the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen collaboration, we describe the observations and automated data movement, data reduction, candidate discovery, and vetting pipeline of our target-of-opportunity DECam observations of S190426c, the first possible NS-black hole merger detected in GWs. Starting 7.5 hr after S190426c, over 11.28 hr of observations, we imaged an area of 525 deg2 (r band) and 437 deg2 (z band); this was 16.3\% of the total original localization probability, and nearly all of the probability visible from the southern hemisphere. The machine-learning-based pipeline was optimized for fast turnaround, delivering transients for human vetting within 17 minutes, on average, of shutter closure. We reported nine promising counterpart candidates 2.5 hr before the end of our observations. One hour after our data-taking ended (roughly 20 hr after the announcement of S190426c), LVC released a refined skymap that reduced the probability coverage of our observations to 8.0\%, demonstrating a critical need for localization updates on shorter ({$\sim$}hour) timescales. Our observations yielded no detection of a bona fide counterpart to m z = 21.7 and m r = 22.2 at the 5{$\sigma$} level of significance, consistent with the refined LVC positioning. We view these observations and rapid inferencing as an important real-world test for this novel end-to-end wide-field pipeline.},

The combination of parameters implies a significant spin for at least one of the black holes in S190521g.

  abstract = {The accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are promising locations for the merger of compact objects detected by gravitational wave (GW) observatories. Embedded within a baryon-rich, high-density environment, mergers within AGNs are the only GW channel where an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart must occur (whether detectable or not). Considering AGNs with unusual flaring activity observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we describe a search for candidate EM counterparts to binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected by LIGO/Virgo in O3. After removing probable false positives, we find nine candidate counterparts to BBH mergers during O3 (seven in O3a, two in O3b) with a p-value of 0.0019. Based on ZTF sky coverage, AGN geometry, and merger geometry, we expect {$\approx$}3(N BBH/83)(f AGN/0.5) potentially detectable EM counterparts from O3, where N BBH is the total number of observed BBH mergers and f AGN is the fraction originating in AGNs. Further modeling of breakout and flaring phenomena in AGN disks is required to reduce our false-positive rate. Two of the events are also associated with mergers with total masses {$>$}100 M {$\odot$}, which is the expected rate for O3 if hierarchical (large-mass) mergers occur in the AGN channel. Candidate EM counterparts in future GW observing runs can be better constrained by coverage of the Southern sky as well as spectral monitoring of unusual AGN flaring events in LIGO/Virgo alert volumes. A future set of reliable AGN EM counterparts to BBH mergers will yield an independent means of measuring cosmic expansion (H 0) as a function of redshift.},

  abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

  abstract = {Gravitational wave (GW) events have several possible progenitors, including black hole mergers, cosmic string cusps, supernovae, neutron star mergers, and black hole-neutron star mergers. A subset of GW events are expected to produce electromagnetic (EM) emission that, once detected, will provide complementary information about their astrophysical context. To that end, the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration has partnered with other teams to send GW candidate alerts so that searches for their EM counterparts can be pursued. One such partner is the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Dark Energy Camera (DECam) Gravitational Waves Program (DES-GW). Situated on the 4m Blanco Telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, DECam is an ideal instrument for optical followup observations of GW triggers in the southern sky. The DES-GW program performs subtraction of new search images with respect to preexisting overlapping images to select candidate sources. Due to the short decay timescale of the expected EM counterparts and the need to quickly eliminate survey areas with no counterpart candidates, it is critical to complete the initial analysis of each night's images within 24 hours. The computational challenges in achieving this goal include maintaining robust I/O pipelines during the processing, being able to quickly acquire template images of new sky regions outside of the typical DES observing regions, and being able to rapidly provision additional batch computing resources with little advance notice. We will discuss the search area determination, imaging pipeline, general data transfer strategy, and methods to quickly increase the available amount of batch computing. We will present results from the first season of observations from September 2015 to January 2016 and conclude by presenting improvements planned for the second observing season.},

  abstract = {Image subtraction is essential for transient detection in time-domain astronomy. The point-spread function (PSF), photometric scaling, and sky background generally vary with time and across the field of view for imaging data taken with ground-based optical telescopes. Image subtraction algorithms need to match these variations for the detection of flux variability. An algorithm that can be fully parallelized is highly desirable for future time-domain surveys. Here we introduce the saccadic fast Fourier transform (SFFT) algorithm we developed for image differencing. SFFT uses a {$\delta$}-function basis for kernel decomposition, and the image subtraction is performed in Fourier space. This brings about a remarkable improvement in computational performance of about an order of magnitude compared to other published image subtraction codes. SFFT can accommodate the spatial variations in wide-field imaging data, including PSF, photometric scaling, and sky background. However, the flexibility of the {$\delta$}-function basis may also make it more prone to overfitting. The algorithm has been tested extensively on real astronomical data taken by a variety of telescopes. Moreover, the SFFT code allows for the spatial variations of the PSF and sky background to be fitted by spline functions.},

  abstract = {We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pach{\'o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg2 field of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six filters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320-1050 nm. The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r {$\sim$} 27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion. We illustrate how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system parameters, and we describe the expected data products and their characteristics.},

  abstract = {We study variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by using the deep optical multiband photometry data obtained from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP) survey in the COSMOS field. The images analyzed here were taken with 8, 10, 13, and 15 epochs over three years in the g, r, I, and z bands, respectively. We identified 491 robust variable AGN candidates, down to I = 25 mag and with redshift up to 4.26. Ninety percent of the variability-selected AGNs are individually identified with the X-ray sources detected in the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey. We investigate their properties in variability by using structure function analysis and find that the structure function for low-luminosity AGNs (Lbol {$\lessequivlnt$} 1045 erg s-1) shows a positive correlation with luminosity, which is the opposite trend for the luminous quasars. This trend is likely to be caused by a larger contribution of the host galaxy light for lower-luminosity AGNs. Using the model templates of galaxy spectra, we evaluate the amount of host galaxy contribution to the structure function analysis and find that dominance of the young stellar population is needed to explain the observed luminosity dependence. This suggests that low-luminosity AGNs at 0.8 {$\lessequivlnt$} z {$\lessequivlnt$} 1.8 are predominantly hosted in star-forming galaxies. The X-ray stacking analysis reveals the significant emission from the individually X-ray undetected AGNs in our variability-selected sample. The stacked samples show very large hardness ratios in their stacked X-ray spectrum, which suggests that these optically variable sources have large soft X-ray absorption by dust-free gas.},

  abstract = {The Prime Focus Imaging Spectrograph (PFIS) will be the workhorse first-light instrument on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Scheduled for commissioning in late 2004, PFIS is a versatile high-throughput imaging spectrograph with a complement of 5 volume-phase holographic gratings for spectroscopic programs from 3200{\AA} to 9000{\AA} at resolutions of R=1500 to R=6000. A magazine of 6 longslits and 30 custom laser-milled slitmasks enables single- or multi-object spectroscopy over an 8 arcminute diameter field. With the gratings stowed, a dual-etalon Fabry-Perot subsystem enables imaging spectroscopy at R=500, R=3000, and R=12,500. The polarization subsystem, consisting of a polarizing beam-splitter used in conjunction with half- and quarter-wave plates, allow linear or circular polarimetric measurements in ANY of the spectroscopic modes. Three mosaiced rapid-readout frame-transfer CCDs provide the capability for time-resolved sampling at rates in excess of 10 Hz. Combinations of these subsystems permit novel observing modes for specialized scientific programs. Examples include high-time resolution multi-object spectral polarizmetry of accreting compact objects, and Fabry-Perot polarimetry or imaging spectral polarimetry of nebulae and stellar clusters. The demands of queue-scheduled observing on a fixed-altitude telescope require that the instrument be capable of rapid reconfiguration between modes.},

With this DR2 release we provide 1449 optical spectra, of which 1182 are released for the first time, for the 858 hard-X-ray-selected AGNs in the Swift BAT 70-month sample. The majority of the spectra (801/1449, 55\%) are newly obtained from Very Large Telescope (VLT)/X-shooter or Palomar/Doublespec. Many of the spectra have both higher resolution (R {$>$} 2500, N {$\sim$} 450) and/or very wide wavelength coverage (3200--10000 {\AA}, N {$\sim$} 600) that are important for a variety of AGN and host galaxy studies. We include newly revised AGN counterparts for the full sample and review important issues for population studies, with 47 AGN redshifts determined for the first time and 790 black hole mass and accretion rate estimates. This release is spectroscopically complete for all AGNs (100\%, 858/858), with 99.8\% having redshift measurements (857/858) and 96\% completion in black hole mass estimates of unbeamed AGNs (722/752). This AGN sample represents a unique census of the brightest hard-X-ray-selected AGNs in the sky, spanning many orders of magnitude in Eddington ratio (L/L Edd = 10-5--100), black hole mass (M BH = 105--1010 M {$\odot$}), and AGN bolometric luminosity (L bol = 1040--1047 erg s-1 ).},

  abstract = {DRAGONS, Data Reduction for Astronomy from Gemini Observatory North and South, is Gemini's new Python-based data reduction platform. DRAGONS offers an automation system that allows for hands-off pipeline reduction of Gemini data, or of any other astronomical data once configured. The platform also allows researchers to control input parameters and in some cases will offer to interactively optimize some data reduction steps, e.g., change the order of fit and visualize the new solution. The project makes good use of other open source projects. The data interface, Astrodata, uses at its core Astropy's NDData and io.fits. The input parameters configuration system uses a slightly modified version of LSST's pex.config. The project is also working with the Astropy community to define the tools needed for building spectroscopic data reduction packages. DRAGONS is used at the observatory for nighttime quality assessment. The same software will be used for quicklook reduction of target-of-opportunity and LSST follow-up observations, and as the tool the researchers can use to prepare their Gemini data for analysis.},

  abstract = {We identified the compact binary merger candidate S230922g during real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) and LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) at 2023-09-22 02:03:44.886 UTC (GPS time: 1379383442.886). The candidate was found by the CWB [1], GstLAL [2], and MBTA [3] analysis pipelines. S230922g is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 1.9e-24 Hz, or about one in 1e16 years. The event's properties can be found at this URL: https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S230922g The classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is BBH ({$>$}99\%), NSBH ({$<$}1\%), BNS ({$<$}1\%), or Terrestrial ({$<$}1\%). Assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability that the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass (HasNS) is {$<$}1\%. [4] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is {$<$}1\%. [4] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassgap) is {$<$}1\%. Two sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page: * bayestar.multiorder.fits,0, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [5], distributed via GCN notice about 27 seconds after the candidate event time. * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [5], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the candidate event time. The preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,1.

  abstract = {The study of stellar surfaces can reveal information about the chemical composition, interior structure, and magnetic properties of stars. It is also critical to the detection and characterization of extrasolar planets, in particular those targeted in extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) searches, which must contend with stellar variability that is often orders of magnitude stronger than the planetary signal. One of the most successful methods to map the surfaces of stars is Doppler imaging, in which the presence of inhomogeneities is inferred from subtle line shape changes in high resolution stellar spectra. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient, and closed-form solution to the problem of Doppler imaging of stellar surfaces. Our model explicitly allows for incomplete knowledge of the local (rest frame) stellar spectrum, allowing one to learn differences from spectral templates while simultaneously mapping the stellar surface. It therefore works on blended lines, regions of the spectrum where line formation mechanisms are not well understood, or stars whose spots have intrinsically different spectra from the rest of the photosphere. We implement the model within the open source starry framework, making it fast, differentiable, and easy to use in both optimization and posterior inference settings. As a proof-of-concept, we use our model to infer the surface map of the brown dwarf WISE 1049-5319B, finding close agreement with the solution of Crossfield et al. (2014). We also discuss Doppler imaging in the context of EPRV studies and describe an interpretable spectral-temporal Gaussian process for stellar spectral variability that we expect will be important for EPRV exoplanet searches.},

Here we report on another superluminal motion measurement, at seven times the speed of light, leveraging Hubble Space Telescope precision astrometry and previous radio VLBI data for GW170817. We thereby obtain a measurement of the Lorentz factor of the wing of the structured jet, as well as substantially improved constraints on the viewing angle (19-25 degrees) and the initial Lorentz factor of the jet core (more than 40).},

  abstract = {The binary neutron-star merger GW170817 was accompanied by radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum and localized to the galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance of about 41 megaparsecs from Earth. The radio and X-ray afterglows of GW170817 exhibited delayed onset, a gradual increase in the emission with time (proportional to t0.8) to a peak about 150 days after the merger event, followed by a relatively rapid decline. So far, various models have been proposed to explain the afterglow emission, including a choked-jet cocoon and a successful-jet cocoon (also called a structured jet). However, the observational data have remained inconclusive as to whether GW170817 launched a successful relativistic jet. Here we report radio observations using very long-baseline interferometry. We find that the compact radio source associated with GW170817 exhibits superluminal apparent motion between 75 days and 230 days after the merger event. This measurement breaks the degeneracy between the choked- and successful-jet cocoon models and indicates that, although the early-time radio emission was powered by a wide-angle outflow (a cocoon), the late-time emission was most probably dominated by an energetic and narrowly collimated jet (with an opening angle of less than five degrees) and observed from a viewing angle of about 20 degrees. The imaging of a collimated relativistic outflow emerging from GW170817 adds substantial weight to the evidence linking binary neutron-star mergers and short {$\gamma$}-ray bursts.},

  abstract = {This work develops application techniques for stochastic modeling of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) variability as a probe of accretion disk physics. Stochastic models, specifically Continuous Auto-Regressive Moving Average (CARMA) models, characterize light curves with a perturbation spectrum and an Impulse-Response function, which crucially provides an interpretation for variability timescales. CARMA timescales are not physical but rather, they describe correlation structure and ordered information in stochastic processes. We begin this tutorial by reviewing discrete auto-regressive and moving-average processes, we bridge these components to their continuous analogs, and lastly we investigate the significance of CARMA timescales, obtained by modeling a light curve in the time domain, in relation to the shape of the power spectrum (PSD) and structure function. We determine that higher order CARMA models, for example the Damped Harmonic Oscillator (DHO or CARMA(2, 1)) are more sensitive to deviations from a single-slope power-law description of AGN variability; unlike Damped Random Walks (DRW or CAR(1)) where the PSD slope is fixed, the DHO slope is not. Higher complexity stochastic models than the DRW capture additional covariance in data and output additional characteristic timescales that probe the driving mechanisms of variability. We provide code using Kali software to generate simulations of diverse complexity stochastic light curves. We also provide a heuristic discussion of aliasing effects in ground-based cadences and the importance of light curve length in regards to uncertainty and limitations in timescale estimation.},

The colors, rapid evolution, and featureless spectrum are consistent with a ``blue'' kilonova from polar ejecta comprised mainly of light r-process nuclei with atomic mass number A{$\lessequivlnt$} 140. This indicates a sightline within \{{\texttheta} \}\{obs\}{$\lessequivlnt$} 45{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ of the orbital axis. Comparison to models suggests {$\sim$}0.03 M {$\odot$} of blue ejecta, with a velocity of {$\sim$} 0.3c. The required lanthanide fraction is {$\sim$} \{10\}-4, but this drops to {$<$} \{10\}-5 in the outermost ejecta. The large velocities point to a dynamical origin, rather than a disk wind, for this blue component, suggesting that both binary constituents are neutron stars (as opposed to a binary consisting of a neutron star and a black hole). For dynamical ejecta, the high mass favors a small neutron star radius of {$\lessequivlnt$} 12 km. This mass also supports the idea that neutron star mergers are a major contributor to r-process nucleosynthesis.},

  abstract = {The recent report of an association of the gravitational-wave (GW) binary black hole (BBH) merger GW190521 with a flare in the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) J124942.3 344929 has generated tremendous excitement. However, GW190521 has one of the largest localization volumes among all of the GW events detected so far. The 90 localization volume likely contains 7400 unobscured AGNs brighter than g 20.5 AB mag, and it results in a 70 probability of chance coincidence for an AGN flare consistent with the GW event. We present a Bayesian formalism to estimate the confidence of an AGN association by analyzing a population of BBH events with dedicated follow-up observations. Depending on the fraction of BBHs arising from AGNs, counterpart searches of \$\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal O \}(1)-\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal O \}(100)\$ GW events are needed to establish a confident association, and more than an order of magnitude more for searches without follow-up (i.e., using only the locations of AGN and GW events). Follow-up campaigns of the top 5 (based on volume localization and binary mass) of BBH events with total rest-frame mass 50 M are expected to establish a confident association during the next LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run (O4), as long as the true value of the fraction of BBHs giving rise to AGN flares is {$>$}0.1. Our formalism allows us to jointly infer cosmological parameters from a sample of BBH events that include chance coincidence flares. Until the confidence of AGN associations is established, the probability of chance coincidence must be taken into account to avoid biasing astrophysical and cosmological constraints.},

  abstract = {We present a new constraint on the Hubble constant H 0 using a sample of well-localized gravitational-wave (GW) events detected during the first three LIGO/Virgo observing runs as dark standard sirens. In the case of dark standard sirens, a unique host galaxy is not identified, and the redshift information comes from the distribution of potential host galaxies. From the third LIGO/Virgo observing run detections, we add the asymmetric-mass binary black hole GW190412 and the high-confidence GW candidates S191204r, S200129m, and S200311bg to the sample of dark standard sirens analyzed in Palmese et al. Our sample contains the top 20\% (based on localization) GW events and candidates to date with significant coverage by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Survey. We combine the H 0 posterior for eight dark siren events, finding \$\{H\}\_\{0\}=\{79.8\}\_\{-12.8\}{\textasciicircum}\{+19.1\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ (68\% highest density interval) for a prior in H 0 uniform between [20, 140] km s-1 Mpc-1. This result shows that a combination of eight well-localized dark sirens combined with an appropriate galaxy catalog is able to provide an H 0 constraint that is competitive ({\textasciitilde}20\% versus 18\% precision) with a single bright standard siren analysis (i.e., assuming the electromagnetic counterpart) using GW170817. When combining the posterior with that from GW170817, we obtain \$\{H\}\_\{0\}=\{72.77\}\_\{-7.55\}{\textasciicircum}\{+11.0\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ .

  abstract = {We present a measurement of the Hubble constant H0 using the gravitational wave (GW) event GW190814, which resulted from the coalescence of a 23 M{$\odot$} black hole with a 2.6 M{$\odot$} compact object, as a standard siren. No compelling electromagnetic counterpart has been identified for this event; thus our analysis accounts for thousands of potential host galaxies within a statistical framework. The redshift information is obtained from the photometric redshift (photo-z) catalog from the Dark Energy Survey. The luminosity distance is provided by the LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave sky map. Since this GW event has the second-smallest localization volume after GW170817, GW190814 is likely to provide the best constraint on cosmology from a single standard siren without identifying an electromagnetic counterpart. Our analysis uses photo-z probability distribution functions and corrects for photo-z biases. We also reanalyze the binary black hole GW170814 within this updated framework. We explore how our findings impact the H0 constraints from GW170817, the only GW merger associated with a unique host galaxy. From a combination of GW190814, GW170814, and GW170817, our analysis yields \$\{H\}\_\{0\}=\{72.0\}\_\{-8.2\}{\textasciicircum}\{+12\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ (68\% highest-density interval, HDI) for a prior in H0 uniform between \$[20{\textbackslash}mathrm\{and\}140]{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ . The addition of GW190814 and GW170814 to GW170817 improves the 68\% HDI from GW170817 alone by {$\sim$}18\%, showing how well-localized mergers without counterparts can provide a significant contribution to standard siren measurements, provided that a complete galaxy catalog is available at the location of the event.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5{$\sigma$} level. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base {$\Lambda$}CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density {\textohm}ch2 = 0.120 {\textpm} 0.001, baryon density {\textohm}bh2 = 0.0224 {\textpm} 0.0001, scalar spectral index ns = 0.965 {\textpm} 0.004, and optical depth {$\tau$} = 0.054 {\textpm} 0.007 (in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence regions on measured parameters and 95\% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03\% precision, with 100{\texttheta}* = 1.0411 {\textpm} 0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant H0 = (67.4 {\textpm} 0.5) km s-1 Mpc-1; matter density parameter {\textohm}m = 0.315 {\textpm} 0.007; and matter fluctuation amplitude {$\sigma$}8 = 0.811 {\textpm} 0.006. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be Neff = 2.99 {\textpm} 0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction Neff = 3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to {$\sum$}m{$\nu$} {$<$} 0.12 eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base {$\Lambda$}CDM at over 2{$\sigma$}, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the {$\Lambda$}CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe, {\textohm}K = 0.001 {\textpm} 0.002. Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be w0 = -1.03 {\textpm} 0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 {$<$} 0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck base-{$\Lambda$}CDM results are in good agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey's combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower fluctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in significant, 3.6{$\sigma$}, tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the Planck data.},

This is the first time that the double-peaked line profile of this nucleus - typical of gas emission from the outer parts of an accretion disc surrounding a supermassive black hole (SMBH) - is reported to vary. From the analysis of the line profiles we find two variability time-scales: (1) the shortest one, between 7 and 28 d, is consistent with the light travel time between the ionizing source and the part of the disc emitting the line; and (2) a longer one of {$\greaterequivlnt$}3 m corresponding to variations in the relative intensity of the blue and red sides of the profile, which can be identified with the dynamical time-scale of this outer part of the accretion disc. We modelled the line profiles as due to emission from a region between {$\approx$}300 and 3000 gravitational radii of a relativistic, Keplerian accretion disc surrounding the SMBH. Superposed on the disc emissivity, the model includes an asymmetric feature in the shape of a spiral arm with a rotation period of {$\approx$}21 m, which reproduces the variations in the relative intensity of the blue and red sides of the profile. Besides these variations, the rms variation profile reveals the presence of another variable component in the broad line, with smaller velocity width W68 (the width of the profile corresponding to 68 per cent of the flux) of {$\sim$}2100 km s-1.},

  abstract = {The broad (FWHM {\textasciitilde} 10,000 km s-1) double-peaked H{$\alpha$} profile from the LINER/Seyfert 1 nucleus of NGC 1097 was discovered in 1991 and monitored for the following 11 years. The profile showed variations attributed to the rotation of gas in a non-axisymmetric Keplerian accretion disk, ionized by a varying radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) located in the inner parts of the disk. We present and model 11 new spectroscopic observations of the double-peaked profile taken between 2010 March and 2011 March. This series of observations was motivated by the finding that in 2010 March the flux in the double-peaked line was again strong, indeed, in 2010 December, even stronger than in the observations of a decade ago. We also discovered shorter timescale variations than in the previous observations: (1) the first, of {\textasciitilde}7 days, is interpreted as due to "reverberation" of the variation of the ionizing source luminosity, and the timescale of 7 days as the light crossing time between the source and the accretion disk; this new timescale and its interpretation provides a distance between the emitting gas and the supermassive black hole and as such introduces a new constraint on its mass; (2) the second, of {$\approx$}5 months, was attributed to the rotation of a spiral arm in the disk, which was found to occur on the dynamical timescale. We use two accretion disk models to fit theoretical profiles to the new data, both having non-axisymmetric emissivities produced by the presence of an one-armed spiral. Our modeling constrains the rotation period for the spiral to be {$\approx$}18 months. This work supports our previous conclusion that the broad double-peaked Balmer emission lines in NGC 1097---and probably also in other low-luminosity active nuclei---originate from an accretion disk ionized by a central RIAF.},

The nearly monochromatic gravitational waves emitted by the decaying orbit of an ultra-compact, two-neutron-star binary system just before the stars coalesce are very likely to be detected by the kilometre-sized interferometric gravitational wave antennas now being designed1-4. The signal is easily identified and contains enough information to determine the absolute distance to the binary, independently of any assumptions about the masses of the stars. Ten events out to 100 Mpc may suffice to measure the Hubble constant to 3\% accuracy.},

  abstract = {The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) discovered gravitational waves (GWs) from a binary black hole merger in 2015 September and may soon observe signals from neutron star mergers. There is considerable interest in searching for their faint and rapidly fading electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, though GW position uncertainties are as coarse as hundreds of square degrees. Because LIGO's sensitivity to binary neutron stars is limited to the local universe, the area on the sky that must be searched could be reduced by weighting positions by mass, luminosity, or star formation in nearby galaxies. Since GW observations provide information about luminosity distance, combining the reconstructed volume with positions and redshifts of galaxies could reduce the area even more dramatically. A key missing ingredient has been a rapid GW parameter estimation algorithm that reconstructs the full distribution of sky location and distance. We demonstrate the first such algorithm, which takes under a minute, fast enough to enable immediate EM follow-up. By combining the three-dimensional posterior with a galaxy catalog, we can reduce the number of galaxies that could conceivably host the event by a factor of 1.4, the total exposure time for the Swift X-ray Telescope by a factor of 2, the total exposure time for a synoptic optical survey by a factor of 2, and the total exposure time for a narrow-field optical telescope by a factor of 3. This encourages us to suggest a new role for small field of view optical instruments in performing targeted searches of the most massive galaxies within the reconstructed volumes.},

We used the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to image a 102 deg2 area, corresponding to 38\% of the initial trigger high-probability sky region and to 11\% of the revised high-probability region. We observed in the i and z bands at 4--5, 7, and 24 days after the trigger. The median 5{$\sigma$} point-source limiting magnitudes of our search images are i = 22.5 and z = 21.8 mag. We processed the images through a difference-imaging pipeline using templates from pre-existing Dark Energy Survey data and publicly available DECam data. Due to missing template observations and other losses, our effective search area subtends 40 deg2, corresponding to a 12\% total probability in the initial map and 3\% in the final map. In this area, we search for objects that decline significantly between days 4--5 and day 7, and are undetectable by day 24, finding none to typical magnitude limits of i = 21.5, 21.1, 20.1 for object colors (i - z) = 1, 0, -1, respectively. Our search demonstrates the feasibility of a dedicated search program with DECam and bodes well for future research in this emerging field.},

Our observations commenced 10.5 hours post-merger, as soon as the localization region became accessible from Chile. We imaged 70 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ in the \$i\$ and \$z\$ bands, covering 93{\textbackslash}\% of the initial integrated localization probability, to a depth necessary to identify likely optical counterparts (e.g., a kilonova). At 11.4 hours post-merger we detected a bright optical transient located \$10.6''\$ from the nucleus of NGC{\textbackslash},4993 at redshift \$z=0.0098\$, consistent (for \$H\_0 = 70\${\textbackslash}, km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ Mpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) with the distance of \$40 {\textbackslash}pm 8\${\textbackslash}, Mpc reported by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration (LVC). At detection the transient had magnitudes \$i{\textbackslash}approx 17.30\$ and \$z{\textbackslash}approx 17.45\$, and thus an absolute magnitude of \$M\_i = -15.7\$, in the luminosity range expected for a kilonova. We identified 1,500 potential transient candidates. Applying simple selection criteria aimed at rejecting background events such as supernovae, we find the transient associated with NGC{\textbackslash},4993 as the only remaining plausible counterpart, and reject chance coincidence at the 99.5{\textbackslash}\% confidence level. We therefore conclude that the optical counterpart we have identified near NGC{\textbackslash},4993 is associated with GW170817. This discovery ushers in the era of multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves, and demonstrates the power of DECam to identify the optical counterparts of gravitational-wave sources.},

  abstract = {Broad ({$\sim$}10,000 km s-1), double-peaked emission-line profiles of Balmer lines emitted by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to originate in the outer parts of an accretion disk surrounding a nuclear supermassive black hole (SMBH), at {$\sim$}1000 gravitational radii, and are most frequently observed in the nuclear spectra of low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) and radio galaxies. In the present paper we argue that broad double-peaked profiles are present also in the spectra of other type 1 AGN, such as Seyfert 1 galaxies, suggesting that the inner part of the broad-line region (BLR) is also the outer part of the accretion disk. We use the Palomar spectral survey of nearby galaxies to show that the only difference between Seyfert 1 BLR line profiles and ``bona fide'' double-peakers is that, in most cases, besides a disk component, we need an additional Gaussian component attributed to nondisk clouds. The recognition that the inner and most variable part of the BLR has a disk geometry suggests that the factor f in the expression to obtain the SMBH mass in type 1 AGN, \{M\}\{BH\}=f(\{R\}\{BLR\}\{\{{$\Delta$} \}\}\{V\}2/G), is f=1/\{{\textbackslash}sin \}2I for the disk-dominated sources. Our median I = 27{$^\circ$} implies f = 4.5, very close to the most recent value of f = 4.3 {\textpm} 1.05, obtained from independent studies. We derive a relation between f and the FWHM of the broad profile that may help to reduce the uncertainties in the SMBH mass determinations of AGN.},

The catalog draws on the 6,649,162 quasar candidates identified by the Gaia mission that have redshift estimates from the space observatory's low-resolution blue photometer/red photometer spectra. This initial sample is highly homogeneous and complete, but has low purity, and 18\% of even the bright (G {$<$} 20.0) confirmed quasars have discrepant redshift estimates ({$\mid\Delta$}z/(1 + z){$\mid$} {$>$} 0.2) compared to those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In this work, we combine the Gaia candidates with unWISE infrared data (based on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer survey) to construct a catalog useful for cosmological and astrophysical quasar studies. We apply cuts based on proper motions and colors, reducing the number of contaminants by approximately four times. We improve the redshifts by training a k-Nearest Neighbor model on SDSS redshifts, and achieve estimates on the G {$<$} 20.0 sample with only 6\% (10\%) catastrophic errors with {$\mid\Delta$}z/(1 + z){$\mid$} {$>$} 0.2 (0.1), a reduction of approximately three times (approximately two times) compared to the Gaia redshifts. The final catalog has 1,295,502 quasars with G {$<$} 20.5, and 755,850 candidates in an even cleaner G {$<$} 20.0 sample, with accompanying rigorous selection function models. We compare Quaia to existing quasar catalogs, showing that its large effective volume makes it a highly competitive sample for cosmological large-scale structure analyses.

Mergers in the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) represent a promising source of origin, with possible observational clues in the gravitational wave data. Beyond gravitational waves, a unique signature of AGN-assisted mergers is electromagnetic emission from the accreting black holes. Here we show that jets launched by accreting black holes merging in an AGN disk can be detected as peculiar transients by infrared, optical, and X-ray observatories We further show that this emission mechanism can explain the possible associations between gravitational wave events and the optical transient ZTF19abanrhr and the proposed gamma-ray counterparts GW150914-GBM and LVT151012-GBM. We demonstrate how these associations, if genuine, can be used to reconstruct the properties of these events' environments. Searching for infrared and X-ray counterparts to similar electromagnetic transients in the future, once host galaxies are localized by optical observations, could provide a smoking gun signature of the mergers' AGN origin.},

  abstract = {About 3\%--10\% of Type I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have double-peaked broad Balmer lines in their optical spectra originating from the motion of gas in their accretion disk. Double-peaked profiles arise not only in AGNs, but occasionally appear during optical flares from tidal disruption events and changing-state AGNs. In this paper, we identify 250 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) among a parent sample of optically variable broad-line AGNs in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, corresponding to a DPE fraction of 19\%. We model spectra of the broad H{$\alpha$} emission-line regions and provide a catalog of the fitted accretion disk properties for the 250 DPEs. Analysis of power spectra derived from the 5 yr ZTF light curves finds that DPE light curves have similar amplitudes and power-law indices to other broad-line AGNs. Follow-up spectroscopy of 12 DPEs reveals that {$\sim$}50\% display significant changes in the relative strengths of their red and blue peaks over long 10--20 yr timescales, indicating that broad-line profile changes arising from spiral arm or hotspot rotation are common among optically variable DPEs. Analysis of the accretion disk parameters derived from spectroscopic modeling provides evidence that DPEs are not in a special accretion state, but are simply normal broad-line AGNs viewed under the right conditions for the accretion disk to be easily visible. We include inspiraling supermassive black hole binary candidate SDSSJ1430+2303 in our analysis, and discuss how its photometric and spectroscopic variability is consistent with the disk-emitting AGN population in the ZTF survey.},

  abstract = {The all sky surveys done by the Palomar Observatory Schmidt, the European Southern Observatory Schmidt, and the United Kingdom Schmidt, the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey have proven to be extremely useful tools for astronomy with value that lasts for decades. The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is mapping the whole sky following its launch on 2009 December 14. WISE began surveying the sky on 2010 January 14 and completed its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will continue to cover the sky a second time until the cryogen is exhausted (anticipated in 2010 November). WISE is achieving 5{$\sigma$} point source sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1, and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 {$\mu$}m. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6.{${''}$}1, 6.{${''}$}4, 6.{${''}$}5, and 12.{${''}$}0 at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 {$\mu$}m, and the astrometric precision for high signal-to-noise sources is better than 0.{${''}$}15.},

  abstract = {We present the Gravitational Wave (GW) Treasure Map, a tool to coordinate, visualize, and assess the electromagnetic (EM) followup of GW events. With typical GW localization regions of hundreds to thousands of square degrees and dozens of active follow-up groups, the pursuit of EM counterparts is a challenging endeavor, but the scientific payoff for early discovery of any counterpart is clear. With this tool, we provide a website and an application programming interface (API) that allows users to easily see where other groups have searched and better inform their own follow-up search efforts. A strong community of Treasure Map users will increase the overall efficiency of EM counterpart searches and will play a fundamental role in the future of multimessenger astronomy.},

  abstract = {The growing number of stellar-mass binary black hole mergers discovered by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo are starting to constrain the binaries' origin and environment. However, we still lack sufficiently accurate modeling of binary formation channels to obtain strong constraints, or to identify subpopulations. One promising formation mechanism that could result in different black hole properties is binaries merging within the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we show that the black holes' orbital alignment with the AGN disks preferentially selects heavier black holes. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations of orbital alignment with AGN disks, and find that AGNs harden the initial black hole mass function. Assuming an initial power-law mass distribution , we find that the power-law index changes by {$\Delta\beta$} {$\sim$} 1.3, resulting in a more top-heavy population of merging black holes. This change is independent of the mass of, and accretion rate onto, the supermassive black hole in the center of the AGN. Our simulations predict an AGN-assisted merger rate of {$\sim$}4 Gpc-3 yr-1. With its hardened mass spectra, the AGN channel could be responsible for 10\%--50\% of gravitational-wave detections.},
